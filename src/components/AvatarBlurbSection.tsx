                        Bananaman is a 32-year-old banana-humanoid born from a radioactive trashcan in New York City. He emerged from pollution as a symbol of transformation through decay. Living in a combat game set on the grimy streets of NYC in 2077, Bananaman thrives on boxing, street fighting, and binge-watching The Price is Right. His sharpest skills are street smarts and price estimation, blending survival instincts with absurd charm. Visually, he’s a pink-bodied figure wrapped in a banana peel, wearing leather boots and gloves, and carrying the faint scent of trash.

                        Set in the year 2077, Bananaman’s world is a futuristic New York City where trash has become an integral part of society. The city is wet, neon-lit, and perpetually grungy, embodying a dystopian charm where humanity has adapted to its waste—using it to build infrastructure and even fuel underground street fights between radioactive trash humanoids. Politically, global tensions simmer just below the surface, with nations trading passive-aggressive blows rather than open warfare. Amid this chaotic yet familiar metropolis, Bananaman makes his home in what he proudly considers the most charming alleyway in the city—a cramped, makeshift burrow carved into a building wall. Inside, a Lazy Boy, TV, and punching bag form the essentials of his simple, dimly lit refuge, illuminated by the soft glow of neon lights filtering through his jagged window.                    </div>
